# CC4104-Creative-Coding

Welcome to my submission for the Creative Coding Portfolio. Below are links to each experiment which demonstrate a variety of creative code techniques and variations learnt both during and outside of classes. Before starting this work, we were required to pick three options from a list of experiments, here is what I selected.

### Experiment #1 - An alternative visual way to represent a realtime clock

### Experiment #2 - A mouse-driven painting tool with 4 different 'brush' tools

### Experiment #3 - An autonomous pattern generator that will create a rich visual effect that is different each time it is run
